## AI System Objective

Build an LLM Twin Writer (TW), an AI character that learns to write like a particular
person by incorporating its style, voice, and personality into an LLM.


## Project Feasibility Study
Before start building an AI/ML solution, there are a few questions to be answered related to alignment with business priorities, data, resources/budget and skills availability, development and runtime cost, development time and return of investment (ROI). These questions are gathered in the [Project Feasibility Study - XXXXXXXXXXX](XXXXXXX).


## Generic AI/ML/LLM System Architecture

The general system architecture is based on the [FTI (Feature-Training-Inference) model - XXXXXXXXX](XXXXXXXXXXX).
